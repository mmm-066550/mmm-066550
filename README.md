# 👋 Hello devs

## 😎 Moustapha's Github Profile

I am a MERN stack developer and I mostly use React & Node js in my side projects. You can check out some of my projects and if you got any questions you can reach out in the links below.


## 💖 What programming languages I like

As a MERN stack developer most of my time I write JavaScript and ReactJs. But in my free time I am trying to build some projects in the backend as well. On serverside I use Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB most of the time because why don't use javascript on backend? 😎
